# TeachMeSkills_C26_Project_M

This repository contains a course project (a program for processing financial documents).

The project aims to create a program for processing payment documents and generating financial reports. 
To access the program, user authentication using a login and password is required. 
The program is designed to process three types of financial documents: invoices, orders and checks, all of them in text format (txt). 
The main purpose is to read information from these documents, compile statistics and provide a comprehensive financial overview.

Features User authentication: 
Access to the program is limited and requires entering a valid login and password. 

Document processing: 
The program takes the path to a folder containing financial documents, reads the information and compiles statistics. 

Document types: 
Three document types are supported: 
invoices, orders and checks. 
Each document type has its own structure and naming pattern.

Processing the current year: 
The program processes only files of the current year (2023). 

Technical documentation: 
The code follows the C4 model for technical documentation. 

Error Handling: 
Various checks have been implemented to ensure reliable execution. 

Logging: 
The program generates logs and saves them in a separate file. 
The logs are divided into general information and error information. 

Processing invalid files: 
After processing, all invalid files are moved to a separate folder. 

Final statistics: 
A summary of statistics is saved in a separate file, including the total turnover for the year and the turnover for each document type.
